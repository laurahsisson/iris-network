# iris-network
Classification neural network with backpropagation written in Clojure. Although the Iris flower dataset is not a fantastic example to use a neural network with because the data is easily, and relatively accurately classified through one trait (petal width), it is famous and small. 
The file automatically runs through this dataset using a neural network with a single hidden layer consisting of 6 neurons. It runs through the training data twice before going on to the test data. To increase the accuracy, either increase the loops or number of neurons. Still, though those two factors increase accuracy, they also increase the risk of overtraining.
